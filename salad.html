        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Hey there! Salad turns downtime into downloads. It mines cryptocurrency at the click of a button and offers lots of great (and often cheaper than retail) rewards.</p>
        <h1>What's the catch?</h1>
        <p>The first, and biggest, issue for Salad is the profitability of cryptocurrency mining rates vs. the electricity cost to run your GPU. You might only make a slight profit. But there are going to be other ways to earn balance soon.</p>
        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
